                    I am Julian Ignacio Parera, a 27-year-old. Since my early 20s, I have been looking for something that makes me feel passionate and excited. I have tried studying several things, and in 2018, I started pursuing a B.A. in Audiovisual Arts at a university in Argentina, expecting to graduate in 2024.

                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, I discovered how useful and interesting Web Development is. I found its possibilities and capabilities to be fascinating. So it was an instant decision; I wanted to study Web Development. Ever since then, I have been studying and attending courses from digital academies as well as various courses on platforms like Udemy and YouTube.
                    Throughout this time, I rapidly progressed from knowing nothing to being capable of building and coding different Web Apps, such as a <i>Loan Website Simulator</i>, a <i>Cryptocurrencies Price Web</i>, a <i>To-do list</i>, and more.
                    Now, I believe I am ready to take my first steps in the IT sector and pursue a fulfilling career in Web Development.
